    "# Upload UV absorbance data to RESA2\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reads UV absorbance data produced by NIVA Lab's spectrophotometer and adds it to RESA2. It provides an alternative to Tore's old Access database named `ABSDATA_IMPORT.accdb`. This is a temporary solution, but will hopefully be faster/more efficient than the current workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of workflow\n",
    "\n",
    " * The analyses are conducted in batches by Erling Bratsberg. Result files for each batch are stored in folders named `AB{yymmdd}` where `{yymmdd}` is the day the analyses were conducted. Files are stored both on the Lab's network drive at `T:\\LAMBDA40P\\UVWINLAB\\DATA` and by Liv Bente at `K:\\Avdeling\\412 Ana\\LAMBDA\\ABSSPEKTER_KAU`. The directory structure in these locations is broadly - but not exactly - the same. **Need to check which source is definitive** <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " * Within each folder, result files are named `xxxxx.SP` where `xxxxx` is the serial number used in Labware. Each sample can be uniquely identified in Labware by the Labware text ID, which is formed as `NR-{year}-{serial_no}`. Each file contains a header (**check what information this contains**), plus UV absorbance results for 701 wavelengths from 200 to 900 nm inclusive <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " * Each folder should also contain one or more \"blank\"/calibration files, usually named either `BLANK.SP` or `BL.SP`. Sometimes both files are present. In this case, I **need to find out how to choose the correct blank for each result file** <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " * The folders may contain files with other extensions, but these can be ignored for the purposes of this workflow <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " * The spectrophotometer uses cuvettes with a fixed length of 5 cm (**check this**). UV absorbance is usually reported per cm, so values should be divided by 5 before upload <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " * Sometimes, very dark samples must be diluted before analysis. In these cases, a dilution factor should also be reported. **Need to find out where this is stored and include it in the code** <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrected values are calculated as\n",
    " \n",
    "$$A_{cor} = \\frac{D(A_{raw} - A_{blank})}{L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_{cor}$ is the corrected value to be uploaded; $A_{raw}$ and $A_{blank}$ are the raw and calibration absorbances at each wavelength, respectively; $D$ is the dimensionless dilution factor; and $L$ is the cuvette length in cm."
